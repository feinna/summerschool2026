# Welcome to the Introduction to Python for Complete Beginners
This is the setup instructions you'll need to complete to take part in the ADM+S Summer School 'Introduction to Python for Complete Beginners' class.

Have a go with completing these setup instructions _well before the class on Friday_. If you get stuck, you can either find me at the summer school (I currently have teal and black hair) or you can email me at jennifer.wilson@monash.edu

- Introduction to Python for Complete Beginners is Session #22, on at 2:45pm on Friday 13 February 2026
- Python website: https://www.python.org/
- Visual Studio Code website: https://code.visualstudio.com/ 

## Information about the class
-  Presenters: Jenn Wilson, James Picone
-  Description: Learn the basics of python programming in a hands-on workshop. We will all build a small script together, starting with printing a simple message to the screen, and making changes from there. This is a taster class for people who want to have a low-risk go at trying out programming. No experience expected.
-  Proposed learning outcomes for participants:
    - Build basic python scripts and run them on their own computer
    - learn how to make adjustments and correct errors in their python code
 
## Things you'll need for the class
- Your laptop
- Python 3 or higher
- Visual Studio Code
- The python extension for Visual Studio Code

## Checking if you already have python
### Operating system: MAC
1. Open Terminal.app using the search function
2. Into the Terminal window, type: python3 -V
   - Please note that the word python is lowercase, there is no space between 'python' and '3', there _is_ a space between '3' and '-' and the 'V' is a capital
3. If you have python installed, it will return a line saying "Python" and a number. If the number starts with a 3 (such as: 3.14.2) then you are good and can move onto the next stage (installing Visual Studio Code). If you do not have Python, or if the number begins with a 2, you will need to install a more recent version of python (see below 'Installing Python')

### Operating system: Windows
1. Open Command Prompt
2. Into the Command Prompt window, type python3 -V
   - Please note that the word python is lowercase, there is no space between 'python' and '3', there _is_ a space between '3' and '-' and the 'V' is a capital
3. If you have python installed, it will return a line saying "Python" and a number. If the number starts with a 3 (such as: 3.14.2) then you are good and can move onto the next stage (installing Visual Studio Code). If you do not have Python, or if the number begins with a 2, you will need to install a more recent version of python (see below 'Installing Python')

### Installing Python
If you do not have an up to date version of Python, you can install it by going to www.python.org and clicking on the 'Downloads' tab in the heading structure. At the top of the page in the blue section, the website will advise the 'latest version' for your operating system. 

Download this and install it.

You can test whether it has succeeded by repeating the commands under 'Checking if you already have python', and you should get a more recent version number appear. If you are having difficulty, you can email me.

### Installing Visual Studio Code
We will be using an _Integrated Development Environment_ called Visual Studio Code. This allows you to run your python script in the environment, provides nice text colours so that you can see your code easily, and provides line numbers down the side so its easy to discuss the code. One doesn't _need_ an IDE to write code, but it _sure is nice_.

1. Please go to the Visual Studio Code website https://code.visualstudio.com/Download
2. Select the download that matches your operating system
3. Download and run the software.
4. Once the software is installed, open Visual Studio Code.

### Installing the Python Extension for Visual Studio Code
The Python extension for Visual Studio Code is something you install from within Visual Studio Code. This extension lets you run your python script within Visual Studio Code. It just makes things a bit faster and easier.
1. On the left hand side of the program there are a number of icons. One is of a few squares. When you click on it, it will say at the top "Extensions".
2. Into the search bar below the word "Extensions" type in "python"
3. A set of results will appear. Click the one that just says "Python". It will have a blue verification icon from Microsoft and will have an icon of two pythons (one blue and one yellow).
4. On the panel on the right you will see a blue button that says 'Install'. Click it and install this extension. This is the extension that lets you run python code within your IDE (so we don't have to use the Terminal window).

## Good work! You're all done and ready to learn to build with python. Yay!
